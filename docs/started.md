# Guide

## Introduction
The Vuetify Currency Field uses [Vue Currency Input](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/) directive to create a currency component (`<v-currency-field>`) with all features of v-text-field.
The component is compatible with vuetify 1.x and 2.x and dynamic binds the props and listeners to v-text-field component.

## Installation

Install the npm package:
``` bash
npm install v-currency-field 
# OR 
yarn add v-currency-field
```

### Vue Cli
#### No Treeshaking

Registry `<v-currency-field>` component globally in your `main.js`:

<<< @/docs/started/main.notreeshaking.js

#### Treeshaking

Registry `<v-currency-field>` and `<v-text-field>` component globally in your `main.js`:

<<< @/docs/started/main.treeshaking.js

With treeshaking enabled, webpack don't reconize v-text-field inside v-currency-field component. That's why is necessery registry `<v-text-field>` globally.

### Nuxt

Configure `@nuxtjs/vuetify` with no TreeShaking:

<<< @/docs/started/vuetify.notreeshaking.js

Add `v-currency-field/nuxt` to the modules section of `nuxt.config.js`:

<<< @/docs/started/nuxt.config.js

#### Treeshaking

Configure `@nuxtjs/vuetify` with TreeShaking:

<<< @/docs/started/vuetify.treeshaking.js

Add `v-currency-field/nuxt-treeshaking` to the modules section of `nuxt.config.js`:

<<< @/docs/started/nuxt.config.treeshaking.js
